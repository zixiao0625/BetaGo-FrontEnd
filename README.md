## Work flow
### Git

1. Create your branch.
2. Work on it, verify it works, test it and then commit.
3. Pull from master and make sure to fix conflicts and your codes still work. Make sure packages are properly added to package.json with npm install.
4. Create a pull request and request at least one people to do code review
5. Merge to the master, then it will automatically deployed on Amplify. Wait for 5 mins and go the domain to check it works well after merging.


## components
- place your compoment in 'react-app/src/components/ComponentName/'
- name your compoments with 'ComponentName.js' and 'ComponentName.css'
- name your compoment properly
- create your static folders inside it (for now) - './img', './icon', etc.
